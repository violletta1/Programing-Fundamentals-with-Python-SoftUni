# Create a class Zoo. It should have a class attribute called __animals that stores the total count of the animals in the zoo.
# The __init__ method should only receive the name of the zoo. There you should also create 3 empty lists (mammals, fishes, birds).
# The class should also have 2 more methods:
# ⦁	add_animal(species, name) - based on the species, adds the name to the corresponding list
# ⦁	get_info(species) - based on the species returns a string in the following format:
# "{Species} in {zoo_name}: {names}
# Total animals: {total_animals}"
# On the first line, you will receive the name of the zoo. On the second line, you will receive number n.
# On the following n lines you will receive animal info in the format: "{species} {name}".
# Add the animal to the zoo to the corresponding list. The species could be "mammal", "fish", or "bird".
# On the final line, you will receive a species.
# At the end, print the info for that species and the total count of animals in the zoo.
